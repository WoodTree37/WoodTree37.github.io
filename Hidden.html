<h2>How are Philosophers critiqued and reviewed?</h2>

<p> 
    Arthur Schopenhauers philosophy is best described by his own facial expression. 
    He mastered the art of hating everything, which led to the accumulation of something like a "thunderstorm" around his head. 
    This "cloud of anger" is often falsely claimed to be his hair. 
    Whereas every other philosopher agreed, that one has to accept the opinion that is supported by arguments the best, Schopenhauer said, Quote: "Fuck y'all wimps",
    and continued by arguing, that only winning the argument is truly important. 
    This of course led to every other philosopher calling him a Quote: "twat", 
    but he made a lot of friends with the common peasant, as these people really only use philosophy for their own good.
